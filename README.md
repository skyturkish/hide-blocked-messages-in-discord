## Motivation

I am a user who accesses Discord via Google Chrome, and I rarely block people. However, I don't even want to see the 'blocked message' text when I do block someone, but unfortunately, Discord does not offer such an option. That's why I wrote this extension. The code is very short, but it gets the job done.
